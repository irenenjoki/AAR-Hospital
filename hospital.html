          <span>AAR hospital is a 140-bed general hospital.  We have an outpatient facility that has been purposefully 
            separated from the urgent care unit. The urgent care unit is designed to receive patients who are in critical 
            condition and need immediate and specialized care. The outpatient unit is for the walk-in patient who needs 
            care without having to wait for a more urgent case to be reviewed. The dialysis Center has ten ultra-modern 
            dialysis seats specifically designed for the comfort of the patient with several settings the patient can 
            choose from. The doctor’s plaza that is within the hospital has the best doctors in different specialties 
            at arm’s length for the convenience of the patients and the patients’ families.

            The critical care unit consists of a fully equipped intensive care unit with twelve beds supported with a 
            nine-bed high dependency unit and a five cot neo-natal unit These are supported by four operating theater 
            rooms. There is a surgical ward and a medical ward. Maternity, gynecology, and pediatric wards round up the 
            ward complement. It is worth noting within each ward, the rooms are divided into a single bed, two beds, 
            three beds, and the largest four-bed units all ensuite. The design of the wards ensures the dignity and 
            privacy of the patients even in our “general four bedrooms”.
            
            AAR Hospital’s mission is to deliver an unparalleled patient experience through a customer-centered approach 
            that leverages on innovation and an engaged workforce.

                    The AAR Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) provides complex 24-hour medical and nursing care, as well
                     as specialised equipment for patients requiring a higher level of care. Patients are admitted to the
                      ICU either electively after a planned major operation or because of an emergency that may arise 
                      during hospital admission. The surgical procedures that require postoperative admission to Intensive
                       Care include all major traumatic, thoracic and neurosurgeries.

Other admission reasons include prolonged and complex surgery and post-operative monitoring of other chronic health 
conditions, such as heart or lung disease. The ICU has 12 beds and adjacent to it, is a nine (9) bed High Dependency
 Unit (HDU) which allows for step down of patients from ICU as they gain recovery and are out of danger. Neonates 
 requiring critical care are attended in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
